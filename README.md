## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1, part 1

  This was fun because it introduced me to this class, and it was really confusing because in the beginning no one had Linux installed and it was really awkard and stressfull because none of the computer were working but it was fun getting to know people. In addition we were getting familirized wth C++ and got a relatively easy task to do and that was writing git log comments to introduce us to the world of C++. 


* Lab 8, part 2

  This was my second favorite lab because part 2 taught me how to play the game poker. In class we even was tought how it was played and everyone enjoyed playing it and knowing that coding this will be challenging. It was challenging but me and my partner figured out how to over this problem and succeded. 

* Lab 4 part 1

   This lab Was amazing because I met a friend her name is admajah and it was fun working with her doing the unit convertion, although it was confusing and weird we ended up working through this lab and got it done and gotten to know this individual a bit more.
